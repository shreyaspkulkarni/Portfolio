Hello! I am pursuing my masters in Computer Science at [Rutgers University-New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/) with concentration in Machine Learning. I have succesfully completed some amazing courses like Computational Robotics, Brain Inspired Computing and Artificial Intelligence with grade of [3.75 GPA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10LA9my1dyQeCYix5ZEdQc-M1yjvXGIiP/view?usp=sharing).

I completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering (2016-2020) from [University of Pune](http://www.unipune.ac.in/) with [8.99 GPA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m2uyUJml5XhMlLTvsZsuYL3Y0TBTLUlL/view?usp=sharing).

I recently worked as an Application Developer Intern for **ADP** in the SRE DevOps team where I worked on full stack developement using ReactJS/Redux/Python and deployment using Docker.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
